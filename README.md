# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Summary 
In this project I created the "PlanMyTrip" app. This app uses beta testers' input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester can choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
